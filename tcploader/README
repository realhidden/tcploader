Launch the included elf or dol using your favourite method of launching homebrew one
your console. It will then start listening on port 8080 and wait for a connection of
the client.

Use henke37 and dasda's gui if you are running on win32. The included binary only works
on linux.

You can get the full source code at http://repo.or.cz/w/svpe-wii.git.
