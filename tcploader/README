Launch the included elf or dol using your favourite method of launching homebrew one
your console. It will then start listening on port 8080 and wait for a connection of
the client.

The win32 version of the client doesn't work currently. You'll have to use linux to test this.

wii/ contains the wii code
pc/ contains a small client to send your file

Type 'make' to build it yourself and don't bother me when it doesn't build for you...
