Just a small Front SD ELF loader with a menu 
Written by svpe, #wiidev@efnet, svpe@gmx.net

Create an elf directory on your SD card and put all your ELF files in there.
You can load the main file with a trucha disc or the twilight hack.

The miniloader is just a quick hack to make this work with trucha discs because
the apploader i used didn't seem to support a non-standard entry point.

Just type make to compile (Hint: a precompiled binary is included.)

There are probably still some bugs so don't blame me if something goes wrong.

See COPYING for the license (GNU GPL 2; and _only_ version 2)
